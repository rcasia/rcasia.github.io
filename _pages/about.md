I'm Ricardo Cas√≠a Moka, a software engineer with a background in Law and
Philosophy, which has given me a unique perspective in my field. Before my
tech career, I was a professional musician. My love for learning earned me
the Minerva award in a Latin translation contest in 2016, (SEEC Madrid).

As an avid learner, I'm always exploring new areas of knowledge and enjoy
diving into the complexities of software development. On this blog, I'll be
sharing useful insights and tips on various tech tools and configurations that
I find helpful. My goal is to provide valuable resources on software
development and personal growth.
