I'm Ricardo Casía Moka, a Senior Software Engineer at Thoughtworks. I architect scalable systems, lead technical initiatives, and mentor development teams for enterprise clients. I'm passionate about clean code, test-driven development, and building software that stands the test of time.

I maintain several open source projects focused on developer tooling. These include [neotest-java]({{ '/projects/neotest-java/' | relative_url }}) and [neotest-bash]({{ '/projects/neotest-bash/' | relative_url }}), test adapters for Java and Bash workflows in Neovim, and [ascii-ui.nvim]({{ '/projects/ascii-ui-nvim/' | relative_url }}), a library of ASCII-based UI components for Neovim plugins.

Through this blog, I share technical insights, engineering practices, and tool configurations to contribute to the developer community.
