I'm Ricardo Casía Moka, a Senior Software Engineer at Thoughtworks with a distinctive background that spans Law, Philosophy, and professional music. This multidisciplinary foundation has shaped my approach to software engineering, enabling me to tackle complex technical challenges with analytical rigor, creative problem-solving, and a deep appreciation for elegant solutions.

At Thoughtworks, I work on delivering high-quality software solutions for enterprise clients, applying agile methodologies and modern engineering practices. My experience encompasses architecting scalable systems, leading technical initiatives, and mentoring development teams. I'm passionate about clean code, test-driven development, and building software that not only meets functional requirements but also stands the test of time.

Beyond my professional work, I'm deeply committed to the open source community. I believe that open source software is fundamental to innovation and knowledge sharing in our industry. Contributing to open source projects allows me to give back to the community that has shaped my career, while also providing opportunities to collaborate with developers worldwide and tackle interesting technical challenges.

I maintain several open source projects focused on enhancing the Neovim development experience. These include [neotest-java]({{ '/projects/neotest-java/' | relative_url }}) and [neotest-bash]({{ '/projects/neotest-bash/' | relative_url }}), test adapters that bring seamless testing capabilities to Java and Bash development workflows within Neovim. I also created [ascii-ui.nvim]({{ '/projects/ascii-ui-nvim/' | relative_url }}), a library of ASCII-based UI components for building beautiful interfaces in Neovim plugins. These projects reflect my passion for developer tooling and my belief in making powerful development tools more accessible.

My journey into technology was preceded by a career as a professional musician and academic pursuits in Law and Philosophy. This unique trajectory has instilled in me a commitment to continuous learning and intellectual curiosity—qualities that earned me the Minerva award in a Latin translation contest (SEEC Madrid, 2016) and continue to drive my professional growth.

Through this blog, I share insights on software engineering practices, technical deep-dives, tool configurations, and reflections on building better software. My goal is to contribute to the developer community by documenting lessons learned, exploring emerging technologies, and discussing the craft of software development from both technical and philosophical perspectives.
